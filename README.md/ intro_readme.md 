1.REACT js is a component based js library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces .it simplfies the creation of single-page applications with a focus on performance and maintainability.
2.import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
in this example:
1 import React from'react':imports React to create components and use JSX
2 function App():
Defines a functional component called App.
3 return():Returns JSX that represents the UI (a div with an h1 tag displaying "hello,world").
4 export default App:Exports the App component so it can be used elsewhere.
3.# WORKING OF REACT:
react operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly 
manipulating the browser's DOM.it performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representatioin before applying changes to the acrual browser DOM.
4. 1. Actual DOM and Virtual DOM

    Initially, there is an Actual DOM(Real DOM) containing a div with two child elements: h1 and h2.
    React maintains a previous Virtual DOM to track the UI state before any updat
    2. Detecting Changes

     When a change occurs (e.g., adding a new h3 element), React generates a New Virtual DOM.
     React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the New Virtual DOM using a process called reconciliation(Reconciliation is the process React
     uses to figure out how to efficiently updte the DOM when changes occur in the UI).
          #How ReactJS Reconciliation Works:
            1.Render Phase 
               - React calls the Render().method of a component togeneratea new virtual DOM representatiom.
               - this new Virtual DOM is compared with the previous virtaul DOM snapshot.
            2. Diffing Algorithm
               - React compares the old and new virtual DOM trees to determine the differences.
               - instead of re-rendering the entire UI ,React updates only the changed nodes.
            3. Commit phase 
               - Once the differenes are determined,React applies the updates to the real DOM in the 
                 most  efficient way.
               - React batches updates and minimizes reflows and repaints for better performance     

    3. Efficient DOM Update

    React identifies the differences (in this case, the new h3 element).
    Instead of updating the entire DOM, React updates only the changed part in the New Actual DOM, making the update process more efficient.
5. One-Way Data Binding

React uses one-way data binding, meaning data flows in a single direction from parent components to child 
components via props. This provides better control over data and helps maintain predictable behavior.
6. State Management 
    React manages component state efficiently using the useState hook or this.state(for class components).State allows dynamic 
    updates without reloading the page.
              1. useState hook
                 the useState hook is a function that allows you to add state to a functional
                 component .it is an alternative to useReducer hook that is preffered when we require the basic 
                 update. useState Hooks are used to add the state variables in the components. For using the useState hook we have
                  to import it in the component.
                  SYNTAX: const[ state,setState]=useState(initialState)
                         -state:it is the value of the cirrent state.
                         -setState:it is the function that is used to upddate the state.
                         -initialState:it is the initial value of the state.
                2. WORKING:
                  1. initialie state:when you call useState(initialValue),it creates a state variable and an updater function.
